TCP is a core protocol for browsers to connect to servers. This project is a quick implementation of such a system in Ruby.
## About TCP
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a protocol aimed at reliable data transfer, with large overhead in comparison to UDP and RTP. TCP specifies several header fields that are verified by the receiver, including a checksum (hash sum), port information and transfer rate information. TCP provides host-host connectivity via the Transport Layer (from the Internet Model).
